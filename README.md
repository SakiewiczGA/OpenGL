# OpenGL
Gayle Sakiewicz
With this project, I was more concerned getting my objects to be drawn seperately (took a couple weeks) and finding a way to draw a textured cylinder than I was with modularity.  If I had more time I would have used the mesh struct more or created other functions to draw each shape.  I've never done anything with computer graphics before so the basic steps were all new, the most exciting was starting to figure out the MVP matrix for scaling and transforming at the end.  I also started to understand the shaders better as well, especially when it came to texture, color, and lights.  Iteration was a factor when it came to drawing the cylinder with a for loop.  I do not know how these skills can help me in the future, educational or professional, but this class has certainly helped me with the skill of perseverance.
